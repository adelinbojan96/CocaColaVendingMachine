# CocaColaVendingMachine
The aim is to design a CocaCola vending machine. The price for one can is 1 leu.

5, 10 and 50 bani coins are accepted. The system is equipped with 5 photocells:
F0 – for the 5 bani coin;
F1 – for the 10 bani coin;
F2 – for the 50 bani coin;
F3 – for rejecting currency (other than those accepted) or foreign bodies;
F4 – for coin acceptance signal.
If there is no Coca Cola then no type of coins (FS) is accepted. The check is made for the total amount and the coins are returned if the amount is not complete (RM). Re release remainder, if applicable.
Signals are generated and signaled for the acceptance of a coin (AM), the total (AT) and for the release of Coca Cola.

The project is made using logisim evolution.
